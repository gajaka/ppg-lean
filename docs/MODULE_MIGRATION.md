# Module migration

The library's 191 theory modules now live in subject directories under
`PPGraph/`. This reorganization changes source paths and import names.
Public declaration names, namespaces, theorem statements, proof bodies and mathematical
references are preserved. The theory inventory still contains 1,824 explicitly
declared theorems and lemmas; the entry points below add no mathematical results.

Use the canonical import in the table when updating a downstream project.
`import PPGraph` remains available for the core graph theory through a small
facade over `PPGraph.Core.Graph`. `import PPGraph.All` imports all 191 theory
modules. The other former flat imports have no compatibility shims.

For example:

```lean
import PPGraph.Certification.Parametric
```

The [machine-readable map](../tools/module-map.json) records the same mapping.
The [current inventory](THEORY_INDEX.md) records theorem counts and direct
project imports for every canonical module. Source and documentation paths are
relative to the repository: the inventory is in `docs/`, and the theory diagram
is in `assets/`.

Verification on macOS, 2026-10-25 passed a fresh 3,919-job build and the full
axiom audit of 1,824 explicit theorems/lemmas and all 4,893 project declarations.
Imported API comparison conserved 4,755 public and 138 private declarations,
including types, declaration kinds, flags and axiom dependencies. Comparison
permits only the exact module mapping in private-name prefixes and documented
compiler hygiene contexts within binder and universe names. User identifiers,
numeric uniqueness/scope counters, referenced constant names and expression/level
constructors remain intact. Theory source changes are confined to import lines.

## Modules added after the reorganization

`PPGraph.Integration.CertificationDependency` was introduced on 2026-10-28 at
its current path. It has no former flat import. Its source-map `old_path` key
therefore equals its current path; the historical migration table above records
only modules that existed before the reorganization.

## API corrections on 2026-10-28

Numerical feasibility names now state their scope:

| Earlier name | Current name |
| --- | --- |
| `locally_repairable` | `lll_budget_feasible` |
| `coupled_obstruction` | `lll_budget_infeasible` |
| `repairable_or_coupled` | `lll_budget_feasible_or_infeasible` |
| `finest_quotient_pp_valid` | `finest_quotient_invariant` |

The renamed Selection invariant helper states only endpoint certification.
`finest_quotient_inherits_pp_valid` now proves actual `pp_valid` with a
well-defined quotient RR. `proj_is_pp_morphism` and `proj_is_pp_quotient` conclude
the shared categorical predicates, with explicit invariant/RR descent and edge
noncollapse arguments. Callers must supply these mathematical obligations;
source edges that collapse do not yield edges between distinct quotient nodes.
