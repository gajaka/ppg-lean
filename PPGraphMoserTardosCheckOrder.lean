  Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma (Moser-Tardos), Theorem 5.7.2 groundwork.

  Verified directly against the source (Moser-Tardos, "A constructive
  proof of the general Lovász Local Lemma", arXiv:0903.0544v3, Section 2,
  Lemma 2.1), not reconstructed from memory - read on 2026-09-20 before
  writing anything here. Lemma 2.1(i)'s properness claim ("if q(u) < q(v)
  and vbl(u), vbl(v) overlap, then d(u) > d(v)") rests on ONE single-step
  fact about `GrowingTree.attachAt`: when a new vertex is attached, EVERY
  candidate for that attachment (in particular any already-present vertex
  sharing a variable with the new label) has address-length at most the
  chosen (max-depth) candidate's - so the newly attached vertex, one level
  deeper than whichever candidate was actually chosen, is STRICTLY deeper
  than every candidate, chosen or not. This file proves exactly that
  single-step fact from the existing `attachAt`/`candidates`/
  `exists_max_depth_candidate` machinery (PPGraphMoserTardosGrowing.lean) -
  no new construction needed, only a genuinely new theorem about the
  existing one.

  Scope, deliberately: this is the LOCAL, single-attachment-step version
  of Lemma 2.1(i), the actual combinatorial engine underneath it. The full
  GLOBAL statement (q(u) < q(v) globally across the whole τ_C(t)
  construction, and its corollary that same-depth vertices have pairwise
  disjoint variable sets) is NOT attempted here - that needs threading
  this single-step fact through the τBuild recursion, a separate,
  substantial next increment. Likewise the τ-check procedure itself
  (Lemma 2.1's "decreasing depth, S(P)-indexed" reading) and its
  correspondence to the real trajectory's per-variable counters
  (`randStep`/`randCount_le`, PPGraphMoserTardosRandomTrajectory.lean) are
  future work, not attempted in this file.

-- Lemma 2.1(i)'s CONCLUSION: same-depth vertices never share a variable.
-- Proved as an invariant maintained at every step of the construction,
-- not extracted after the fact - avoids needing to name "which step
-- attached this vertex" at all.
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------

/-- Same-depth vertices of a GrowingTree never share a variable. Stated
    for an arbitrary tree so the induction below can invoke it as its
    own hypothesis at each step of the construction. -/

    T.lab u ≠ T.lab v ∧ ¬ neighbor P (T.lab u) (T.lab v)

/-- Helper for the step case: an OLD vertex `u` at the SAME depth as the
    address about to be freshly attached (with label `a`) cannot share a
    label with `a` - `u` would otherwise be a candidate, but every
    candidate is STRICTLY shallower than the new address
    (`attachAt_new_vertex_deeper_than_any_candidate`), contradicting equal
    depth. Isolated so it is proved once and reused for both orderings of
    the pair (new-then-old and old-then-new) in the main induction. -/

/-- Moser-Tardos Lemma 2.1(i)'s conclusion, proved as an invariant of the
    τC(t) construction: at every step, same-depth vertices are
    label-independent. Base case: the singleton root has only one
    address, so the `u ≠ v` hypothesis is vacuous. Step case, attach
    branch: `attachAt_new_old_sameDepth_indep` handles the two mixed
    (new/old) orderings directly; both-old falls back to the induction
    hypothesis (labels there are literally unchanged by the attachment);
    both-new is excluded since there is only ever ONE new address. -/
