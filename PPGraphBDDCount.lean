  "Count of components = safe parallel units" - the corollary flagged as
  future work on 2026-09-05 (PPGraphBDD.lean), now cheap thanks to
  2026-09-20's PPGraphBDDLaplacian.lean: connects the SimpleGraph-based
  component COUNT (`Fintype.card (bddGraph vars B).ConnectedComponent`,
  which the Laplacian file already relates to the nullspace dimension) to
  the pre-existing, C-indexed `compOf` vocabulary that
  `repair_noninterference_all` (PPGraphBDD.lean Section 3) actually uses.

  The result: `repair_noninterference_all` already proves that repairs
  confined to two DIFFERENT compOf-groups never interfere. This file
  proves there are EXACTLY `Fintype.card (bddGraph vars B).ConnectedComponent`
  many such groups - so that count is not just an abstract spectral
  quantity (today's Laplacian-nullspace result), it is the precise number
  of independently, safely parallelizable repair units.

/-- The number of BDD components equals the number of distinct

    independently, safely parallelizable repair units guaranteed by
    `repair_noninterference_all`. Combined with
    `card_bddComponents_eq_finrank_ker_lapMatrix`

/-- The full statement: `B` splits into `Fintype.card

    exactly what `repair_noninterference_all` guarantees: a repair
    confined to one group's footprint cannot affect `sat` for anything in
    a genuinely different group. This is the corollary flagged as future
    work on 2026-09-05, now closed. -/
