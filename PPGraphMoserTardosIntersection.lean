  He--Li--Sun, Proposition 3.3: the intersection saving for two orders
  of resampling shared variables. Independent private blocks X and Z
  are kept fixed while the shared block Y is sampled twice.

  arXiv:2111.06527, Proposition 3.3, p. 12.

  This is the local probability estimate used by the stronger criterion;
  its connection to witness DAGs and the final MT convergence theorem
  is subsequent work. All spaces below are arbitrary measurable spaces.
