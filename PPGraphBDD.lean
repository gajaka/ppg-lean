  Blocking Dependency Decomposition: connected components of the dependency
  graph over a blocking set, and the non-interference guarantee that
  justifies treating different components as safely independent.

  Not from the book - original. Builds directly on PPGraphProbabilistic.lean's
  `CertVars`/`dependent`/`blocking_dep_graph`: the dependency graph on a
  blocking set already existed there (edge iff shared variable); what was
  missing is its decomposition into connected components and a proof that
  different components genuinely don't interfere under independent repair.

  Motivated by the 2026-09-05 structural experiments in
  ~/Desktop/lll-proof-search-papers/ (exp_b1_structural_bdd.py,
  exp_b3_real_lean_metavar.lean): synthetically and then Lean-elaborator-
  confirmed that naive "N open goals" tracking misjudges safe parallelism
  whenever goals/certificates share a resource (a metavariable, in the
  proof-search reading; an observable variable, in the original CPS
  reading here). This file formalizes the mechanism itself - a purely
  structural, graph-theoretic claim. Nothing here is a probabilistic
  statement, so nothing here depends on whether `lll_independence` or
  `lll_lopsidependence` hold for any domain; it is immune to the
  2026-09-04 finding that lopsidependence fails for structural
  metavariable coupling under a neutral synthetic model.

  Deliberately scoped as "non-interference", not "repair succeeds": this
  file proves that repairing one component never changes the evaluation of
  a certificate/obligation in a different component - it does NOT claim a
  repair exists or succeeds (that remains the province of `locally_repairable`/
  `coupled_obstruction` in PPGraphProbabilistic.lean, which is a genuinely
  separate, harder question). Concretely, this is the formal counterpart of
  the "hub" experiment (exp_b2 / `hub_conflict_demo` in exp_b1_structural_bdd.py):
  there, committing an instantiation that only respects one goal's own
  constraint broke a goal sharing its variable; here, the theorem says that
  can only happen WITHIN a component - a change confined to one component's
  footprint provably cannot break anything outside it.

  Section 4 (added same day) connects this to `lll_feasible` from
  PPGraphProbabilistic.lean: feasibility of the whole blocking set B is
  exactly feasibility checked independently per component - the formal
  reason "Blocking Dependency Decomposition" and "the Local Lemma" belong
  together (matching paper6.tex's section title), not just two facts that
  happen to sit in the same file.

-- Section 1: the same-component relation.
-- Reusing the running example from PPGraphProbabilistic.lean: B =
-- {c1,c2,c3,c5,c6}, vars(c1)={v1,v2}, vars(c2)={v2,v3}, vars(c5)={v1,v6},
-- vars(c6)={v2,v7}, vars(c3)={v4}. c1,c2,c5,c6 are all pairwise reachable
-- through shared variables (c1~c2 via v2, c1~c5 via v1, c1~c6 via v2), so
-- they form one component; c3 shares nothing with anyone and is its own
-- singleton component - matching `neighbors`/`dependent` already computed
-- there for this exact example.

/-- Two certificates in B are directly coupled if they share a variable -
    this is exactly `blocking_dep_graph`'s edge condition, restated as a
    plain binary relation (dropping the `c1 ≠ c2` clause, since it plays no
    role once we take the equivalence closure below - `dependent vars c c`
    is possible but harmless, reflexivity is added separately anyway). -/

/-- c1 and c2 are in the same BDD component of B iff they are connected by
    some chain of shared-variable couplings within B - the smallest
    equivalence relation containing `CoupledIn`. This is what lets c1 and c3
    (in the running example) end up in different components even though
    the definition only ever looks at *direct* pairwise sharing: c1 reaches
    c2, c5, c6 this way, but nothing chains from any of them to c3. -/

-- Section 3: non-interference of repair across different components.
-- `sat` stands for whatever "this certificate/obligation currently holds"
-- means in a given domain - a physical certificate condition in the
-- original CPS reading, or "this Lean subgoal is closed" in the
-- proof-search reading (exp_b3's ?n/?m examples). `Local` is the frame/
-- locality hypothesis this needs, made an explicit premise rather than an
-- assumption: evaluating c must depend only on the coordinates in Vars(c),
-- nothing else - exactly the same shape as `IsCylinderOver` in
-- PPGraphVariableLLL.lean, here for an arbitrary value type instead of ℝ.

variable {α : Type}

/-- sat's evaluation of c depends only on the instantiation restricted to
    Vars(c) - the locality/frame condition non-interference is built on.
    Not free: it must be checked for whatever `sat` a given application
    actually uses, exactly as `dependent`/`independent` already had to be
    checked (not assumed) for the CPS domain. -/

/-- Non-interference: if a repair changes the instantiation only within c1's
    component's footprint (agrees with the original everywhere else), then
    for any c2 in a *different* component, sat c2's truth value is
    completely unaffected. This is deliberately NOT a claim that a repair
    exists, succeeds, or finds a satisfying instantiation for c1 itself -
    only that whatever it does to c1's own component, it cannot silently
    break anything outside it. The formal counterpart of what
    `hub_conflict_demo` (exp_b1_structural_bdd.py) showed going wrong
    *inside* one component when this locality is violated across a shared
    variable. -/

/-- The safety guarantee extends to ALL of B outside c1's component at

-- breath, not just two facts that happen to sit in the same file. In the
