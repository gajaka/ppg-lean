  Step 3: bound the occurrence probability of a fixed canonical witness
  by its tree weight. If the shape occurs, one realized raw τC tree is
  fixed once as its representative. Canonical check invariance then
  transports every occurrence to that representative's check event.

  The representative is fixed before applying the product-measure
  theorem; it does not vary with the sample being integrated.
