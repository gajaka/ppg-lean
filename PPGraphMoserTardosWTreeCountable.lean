  Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma (Moser-Tardos), `Countable (WTree ι)`.

  Needed for E[T_LOG]'s final assembly (step 3's summability over WTree
  shapes, per PPGraphMoserTardosProbabilityGeneral.lean's roadmap) -- flagged
  in PPGraphMoserTardosToGrowingTreeCheckBridge.lean's own session notes as
  NOT auto-derivable, since WTree's constructor takes a `List (WTree ι)`
  argument (a nested recursive occurrence Lean's automatic
  Countable/Encodable deriving does not handle).

  Proof strategy (stratify by WTree.size, not a flattened S-expression
  encoding -- simpler to make rigorous without a hand-written decoder):
  for each n, the set of trees with size <= n is Countable, by induction
  on n. A tree of size <= n+1 decomposes into a label plus a list of
  children, EACH of size <= n (since a child's size is at most the sum of
  all children's sizes, which is at most n); Countable is closed under
  List and Prod, so the induction step is a `Countable.of_injective` into
  `ι × List (Bounded n)`. Every tree trivially has size <= its own size,
  so `WTree ι` embeds into the countable sigma type `Σ n, Bounded n` via
  `t ↦ ⟨t.size, t, le_refl _⟩` -- injective since the second component
  alone already recovers `t`.

/-- Trees of size at most `n`, as a subtype. `abbrev` (not `def`) so `simp`/unification see
    straight through to the underlying `Subtype` -- a plain `def` here blocked `List.map_map`
    from matching during the injectivity proof below (confirmed via an isolated scratch repro:
    the identical simp call succeeded against a bare `{t // t.size ≤ n}` but stalled against this
    same type spelled as a `def`-wrapped abbreviation). -/
