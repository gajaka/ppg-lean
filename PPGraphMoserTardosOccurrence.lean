  Step 3: measurable occurrences of canonical witness shapes.
  The random initial state is supplied by slot 0 of the same log.

  A witness at a fixed time depends on finitely many selected labels.
  Factoring through that finite label history proves measurability;
  countability of WTree alone would not prove this fact. An occurrence
  is then a countable union over the active real times, including 0.
