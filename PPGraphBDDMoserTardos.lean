  PPGraphBDDMoserTardos.lean
  Connects Blocking Dependency Decomposition (PPGraphBDD.lean) to the
  Moser-Tardos resampling process (PPGraphMoserTardosProcess.lean).

  Not from the book - original, same-day follow-up to PPGraphBDD.lean's
  Section 4 (which connected BDD to `lll_feasible`, the STATIC feasibility
  check). This file is the DYNAMIC analog: `lll_feasible_iff_componentwise`
  said checking feasibility over a whole blocking set is the same as
  checking it component by component; this file says RUNNING Moser-Tardos
  confined to one component provably never touches another.

  The connection turns out to already be half-built: PPGraphMoserTardosProcess.lean's
  `mt_step_preserves_unrelated` (resampling an event can't change whether a
  disjoint-footprint event is violated) is exactly the single-step version
  of the non-interference principle PPGraphBDD.lean formalizes generally.
  What was missing is the bridge - showing that "different BDD component"
  (SameComponent's negation) implies the footprint-disjointness
  `mt_step_preserves_unrelated` actually needs, and then iterating that
  single step across an entire trajectory.

  An `MTProcess`'s `footprint : ι → Finset V` field is literally a
  `CertVars ι V` (both are just `ι → Finset V`), so all of PPGraphBDD.lean's
  vocabulary (`SameComponent`, `compOf`, `componentFootprint`, ...) applies
  directly with C := ι and vars := P.footprint - no new dependency-graph
  machinery needed, just the bridge argument.
