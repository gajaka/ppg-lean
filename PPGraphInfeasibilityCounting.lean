  Exact inclusion-exclusion counts and positive-weight infeasibility.
  Probability and Computing, Lemma 1.3 (inclusion-exclusion); uses the
  established mathlib theorem Finset.inclusion_exclusion_card_biUnion.
  All intersections are actual event intersections, not graph-only bounds.
  Zero mass implies emptiness only with explicitly positive atom weights.
