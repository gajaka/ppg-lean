  Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma (Moser-Tardos)

  Layer 4, Part C: the counting half of Theorem 5.7.1 (Alon-Spencer
  §5.7, p.83) -- "the number of times event A is resampled among the
  first T steps equals the number of DISTINCT proper witness trees
  rooted at A that occur as τ_C(t) for some genuine (actually-violated)
  t < T" -- built directly from the already-proved injectivity
  (`τC_injective_on_occurrences`, PPGraphMoserTardosInjectivity.lean)
  via `Finset.card_image_of_injOn`.

  SCOPE, stated honestly: this file gives the COUNTING identity only.
  It does NOT attempt Theorem 5.7.2 (Pr[T occurs] ≤ p(T), the
  "injective encoding of independent coin-flips" probability argument)
  -- that is the hardest, most technical part of the whole
  Moser-Tardos proof, a substantial undertaking on its own, and is left
  for a dedicated follow-up. Taking expectations of the identity proved
  here, once 5.7.2 exists, is what would finally connect
  `sum_mtWeight_le` (PPGraphMoserTardosConvergence.lean) to an actual
  E[TLOG] bound.

  Also fixes a real gap surfaced while designing this file:
  `pickFirstViolated` (PPGraphMoserTardosRandomTrajectory.lean) was
  proved MEASURABLE but never proved to actually behave like a
  resampling policy should -- that it picks a genuinely violated event
  whenever one exists. `pickFirstViolated_mem_violated` below closes
  that gap; TLOG (below) is defined in terms of "genuinely violated"
  steps precisely because of it.

  Builds on PPGraphMoserTardosRandomTrajectory.lean (pickFirstViolated,
  pickFromList, randTraj) and PPGraphMoserTardosInjectivity.lean
  (τC, τC_injective_on_occurrences).

/-- If some event in `l` is violated at `ω'`, `pickFromList` returns a
    violated one (not necessarily the same `j` that witnessed
    nonemptiness -- whichever comes first in `l` -- but violated
    regardless). Induction on `l`, mirroring `pickFromList`'s own
    recursion. -/
