  Matrix representation of the BDD dependency graph: an incidence matrix
  M : C -> V -> R (rows = certificates, columns = variables, M c v = 1 iff
  v in vars c) whose Gram matrix M * Mᵀ recovers `dependent` exactly:
  (M * Mᵀ) c1 c2 = |vars c1 ∩ vars c2|, and that is positive iff c1, c2
  are dependent (PPGraphProbabilistic.lean's `dependent`, restated as a
  Nonempty intersection). This is a restatement, not a new mathematical
  fact - the point is to make the existing CoupledIn/dependent structure
  visible to linear-algebra/spectral-graph-theory tooling (e.g. Mathlib's
  `SimpleGraph.lapMatrix` and `card_connectedComponent_eq_finrank_ker_toLin'_lapMatrix`,
  which already proves "component count = Laplacian nullspace dimension"
  for a SimpleGraph - not attempted here, this file only builds the bridge
  that a future file could use to connect BDD's `SameComponent` to that
  theorem, should the `SimpleGraph.ConnectedComponent` overhead ever be
  judged worth paying).

/-- THE BRIDGE: two certificates are `dependent` (share a variable) iff
    the corresponding entry of the incidence matrix's Gram matrix M Mᵀ
    is positive. Matches `CoupledIn` (`PPGraphBDD.lean`), which is
    `dependent` restricted to B - so `CoupledIn vars B c1 c2` holds iff
    `c1, c2 ∈ B` and `(M Mᵀ) c1 c2 > 0`. -/
