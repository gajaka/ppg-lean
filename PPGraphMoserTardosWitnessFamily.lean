  The unbounded canonical witness family is the increasing union of
  the finite enumerations wtreesUpTo. Its total ENNReal weight is the
  supremum of the finite-depth mtWeight values.

  Restricting the sum to this family is essential: summing over all
  rooted ordered WTree values would also count sibling permutations.
  The depth-uniform algebraic convergence bound therefore controls
  the full canonical-family sum without assuming convergence first.
