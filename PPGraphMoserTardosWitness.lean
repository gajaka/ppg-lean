  Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma (Moser-Tardos)

  Layer 3, Part A: dependency graph + witness tree data structure.
  Builds on PPGraphMoserTardosProcess.lean (MTProcess, mtTrajectory,
  mt_new_violation_overlaps).

  The backward construction of τ_C(t) from a log, and the injectivity
  argument (N_A = number of distinct proper witness trees rooted at A
  occurring in C), are deliberately NOT attempted here -- that
  construction (attach a new child to the vertex of MAXIMUM DEPTH,
  among current vertices v with C(i) ∈ Γ+([v]), scanning the log
  backwards) needs an addressable/zipper tree representation, not the
  plain immutable rose tree below. This file only sets up the graph
  and the tree SHAPE that construction targets, checked directly
  against Moser & Tardos, "A constructive proof of the general Lovász
  Local Lemma" (arXiv:0903.0544v3), Section 2, Definition of witness
  tree and Lemma 2.1 -- NOT Alon-Spencer §5.7, which (3rd ed., ~2008)
  predates this algorithm and covers Beck's unrelated 1991 method
  instead.

  Witness tree, verbatim (Section 2): "A witness tree τ = (T, σ_T) is
  a finite rooted tree T together with a labelling σ_T : V(T) → 𝒜 of
  its vertices with events such that the children of a vertex
  u ∈ V(T) receive labels from Γ+(σ_T(u))." Γ+(A) := Γ(A) ∪ {A} is the
  INCLUSIVE neighborhood, so a child MAY repeat its parent's own
  label. "If distinct children of the same vertex always receive
  distinct labels we call the witness tree proper" -- properness is
  a SIBLING-distinctness condition, not global distinctness.
