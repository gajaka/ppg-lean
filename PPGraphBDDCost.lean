  "Graph governs map": the formal bridge connecting Blocking Dependency
  Decomposition (PPGraphBDD.lean) to cost-minimization instead of
  satisfaction-checking - the missing piece identified in session_state.md's
  2026-09-16 "TWO CLEAN FORWARD DIRECTIONS" note (direction 1, "the solid,
  low-risk path... just not yet written in transport terms").

  PPGraphBDD.lean already proves the SATISFACTION-CHECKING half of "graph
  governs map": `lll_feasible_iff_componentwise` (feasibility over B is
  exactly feasibility checked independently per component) and
  `repair_noninterference` (repairing one component cannot change whether a
  certificate in a different component is satisfied). Both are about a
  Boolean/Prop-valued question (does sat hold). This file proves the
  analogous fact for a REAL-VALUED cost - the actual mathematical content
  behind the "transport map factorizes over BDD components" claim that
  exp_transport_vs_bdd.py (v2) validated empirically on synthetic data:
  squared-distance cost decomposes additively over disjoint variable blocks,
  so the jointly-optimal cost equals the sum of independently-optimal
  per-component costs. That empirical finding is a special case (squared
  Euclidean norm) of the general fact proved here (any cost that is LOCAL to
  each certificate's own variables).

  Scope, deliberately: proved for ONE component (`compOf vars B c1`) versus
  "everything else in B" (`B \ compOf vars B c1`), mirroring
  `repair_noninterference`/`repair_noninterference_all`'s own one-component-
  vs-the-rest shape rather than building a full quotient-into-many-components
  machinery. Applying this once per component of a full partition recovers
  the "sum over ALL components" statement; a dedicated multi-way version is
  future work if the induction is ever needed as a single theorem.

  The optimization domain is kept FINITE (V, alpha both Fintype) rather than
  a continuous transport/Wasserstein space - this matches what was actually
  validated (exp_transport_vs_bdd.py's discrete permutation search over a
  finite candidate set, not continuous optimal transport), and lets the
  minimum be taken via `Finset.inf'` over `Finset.univ : Finset (V -> alpha)`,
  avoiding `sInf`/`iInf` junk-value issues over an unbounded continuous
  domain. A continuous-OT version, if ever wanted, is a separate, harder
  undertaking (real Wasserstein/Monge machinery, not attempted here).

-- This is the literal "graph governs map" bridge: the globally-optimal cost
-- over the whole blocking set B decomposes EXACTLY (not just an inequality)
-- into the optimal cost achievable on one component plus the optimal cost
-- achievable on everything else - solving per-component and combining gives
-- the same answer as solving jointly. Matches exp_transport_vs_bdd.py's
-- `cost_joint_optimal = cost_B1_optimal + cost_B2_optimal` (equality case),
-- now as a theorem instead of an empirical observation on synthetic data.

/-- Main theorem: the "graph governs map" bridge. The globally-optimal cost
    over the whole blocking set B is EXACTLY the optimal cost on c1's
    component plus the optimal cost on everything else in B outside it -
    solving the cost-minimization problem per BDD component and adding the
    results gives the same answer as solving it jointly over all of B. This
    is the cost-minimization counterpart of `lll_feasible_iff_componentwise`
    (PPGraphBDD.lean): that theorem showed feasibility-checking localizes to
    components; this theorem shows the same for optimization. -/
