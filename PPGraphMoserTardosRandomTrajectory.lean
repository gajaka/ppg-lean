  Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma (Moser-Tardos)

  Layer 4, Part B: the actual random trajectory, built from `LogSpace`
  (PPGraphMoserTardosLogSpace.lean) instead of an arbitrary log, and
  its measurability at each fixed time step -- the fact Theorems 5.7.1
  /5.7.2 (Alon-Spencer §5.7) need before "the probability that witness
  tree T occurs" is even a well-posed question.

  The "which violated event to fix next" policy is NOT left as an
  abstract hypothesis: it is built concretely (`pickFirstViolated`,
  scanning a fixed enumeration of ι and taking the first violated
  event), and its measurability is PROVED, not assumed. The one
  genuinely new standing hypothesis is `hbad : ∀ i, MeasurableSet
  (P.bad i)` on the MTProcess -- structurally necessary for "is event
  i violated" to be a meaningful measurable question at all; nothing
  in PPGraphMoserTardosProcess.lean's own definition of MTProcess
  guarantees it.

  Builds on PPGraphMoserTardosLogSpace.lean (LogSpace, freshState,
  measurable_freshState) and PPGraphMoserTardosProcess.lean (MTProcess,
  resample from PPGraphMoserTardos.lean).

    a PLAIN (non-dependent-looking, once v is fixed) function `ℕ →

    `ω (n, v) : S.space (n, v).2` does not reduce to `S.space v`
    automatically in every elaboration context (hit as a real compile
    error below when `measurable_eval_bounded` was first stated

    many possible index values 0..N, the same technique as
    `pickFromList`'s chaining over ι. Induction on N: the base case
    N=0 forces `idx a = 0` everywhere, giving a constant function; the
    step splits on `idx a = N+1` (giving the constant `ω (N+1,v)`) vs.
    `idx a ≤ N` (handled by the IH applied to the "clamped" index
    `min (idx a) N`, which agrees with `idx` exactly where the split
    puts us). This is the tool `drawFrom ω (cnt ω)`'s measurability in
    ω needs below, since `cnt ω v` depends on the whole run so far but

    footprint comes from EACH variable's OWN counter via `drawFrom`,
    read at `counter + 1` rather than `counter` directly -- slot `0` of
    each variable's log is reserved for the INITIAL value `ω0`
    (matching Moser-Tardos's own convention, arXiv:0903.0544v3 p.5:
    "P was sampled at the beginning of the algorithm [slot 0] and then
    at the steps q(w) < q(v) for w ∈ S(P) [slots 1, 2, ...]"), so the
    FIRST actual resample of a variable must consume slot 1, not slot
    0. Every variable actually in the footprint has its counter bumped
    by one afterward (its own use just consumed that slot), everyone
    else keeps their counter unchanged. -/
